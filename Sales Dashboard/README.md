# 📊 Sales Dashboard for A Hardware Company  

## 🚀 Problem Statement  

A leading supplier of computer hardware and peripherals, serves multiple clients across India. With its head office in Delhi and regional offices nationwide, the company operates in a dynamically evolving market.  

Mr. X, the Sales Director, faces challenges in tracking sales trends and obtaining clear business insights. Currently, he relies on verbal updates from Regional Managers overseeing North, South, and Central India. However, these insights are often subjective and may not provide a complete picture. While Mr. X observes declining sales, the lack of a centralized, data-driven approach makes it difficult to pinpoint key areas of concern and growth opportunities.  

### 🔍 Key Challenges  
1. **Lack of Real-Time Insights** – Sales data is scattered, leading to delays in decision-making.  
2. **Subjective Reporting** – Regional Managers provide verbal updates, which may not always be accurate.  
3. **Need for Data-Driven Decisions** – Mr. X requires a clear, concise, and visual representation of business performance.
